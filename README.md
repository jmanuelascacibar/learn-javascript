# Learn JavaScript for Free - Study Repository

This repository is a fork/clone of the original ["Learn JavaScript for Free"](https://github.com/original-owner/original-repo) course provided by [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com). We are not the authors of this content but have cloned it to follow along and practice JavaScript as part of a learning exercise.

## Purpose
This repo serves as our personal workspace for completing the challenges and lessons from the Scrimba "Learn JavaScript for Free" course. We’ve uploaded it here to track our progress, collaborate (if applicable), and apply what we’re learning about JavaScript.
